An interactive web based quiz. Users are given a random selection of questions taken from a list of questions stored in a database.

Users can then review their answers, and try again using another random set of questions.

Questions can be multiple choice, checkbox,  text or number based. The text allows for regular expression checking of the answer and the number allows for numerical ranges.

The quiz is administered through a web front end, and can be incorporated into an existing web site design.

An off-line feature (which can be disabled), allows the users to print off a list of questions which can be completed off-line or shared with friends.
