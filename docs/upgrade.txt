To upgrade to the latest CVS just copy the files over your existing setup. 
The quiz.cfg and template files will not be replaced by an upgrade
so any customised pages should be OK.

If you have made any further customisations e.g. to the admin templates then 
these will be overwritten so please make sure you have a backup before 
performing an upgrade.

This software is under development and comes with no guarantee. I do not 
recommend you use this on a production environment, without first 
rigorously testing your setup.
