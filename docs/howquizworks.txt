How the quiz works

Templates are parsed before use

Variables are not case sensitive


%%HeaderJavascript%%
- allows inline javascript to be included
- include this entry in all header templates as it will be ignored if not required
- should normally be the last entry before </head>

%%ThemeDirectory%%
Include this anywhwere that the path to the theme directory is required (trailing / is included)


Note that php includes can be used as long as enabled using setting
template_allow_include = true in the settings (default)
They must be entered as <?php include('____');?> - must be on a single line
// only one include can be included on a single line, but other text or html can be included in the same line
require / require_once are not supported

The %% Variables are parsed prior to any php tags.
Therefore it is possible to include Variables within the include statement

... more variables will be added in future

Upgrades
--------
Pre-upgrade
Edit the quiz.cfg file so that all entries are on a single line per variable value pair
eg. %quizintro needs to be on a single line



quickstart.php
--------------

Embed as 

IndexFile is the path and filename of the index.php file (in reference to where it is embedded)
<?php $IndexFile = "/quiz/index.php"; include("quiz/quickstart.php");?>




Sessions
--------
Users do not need to login, but Facebook logins will be added in future version (for social network features) 


Sessions are tracked using PHP sessions (see later)


Admin
-----

login is required for admin functionality (uses local login rather than facebook)


Quiz setup
----------
Questions are chosen as a random selection from those in that quiz category.
The list is stored in faquiz_active, so that they can be referred
to during the quiz and at the review. 

As a housekeeping feature every 100 (or configured) completed quizzes the mark function will
clear out entries over 4 hours old (or configured).

Images are not stored in the DB. Instead are served up as URL's.

Offline Quiz
------------
The offline quiz needs to create a unique code. To do this we increment the value of offline.qcl whenever a new session
is started. It has to exist when first run with a value of 1.

When move this over to DB we need to use locking on the DB as there could be simultaneous updates

Constraints
-----------
Answer cannot be -1 (means not answered)
Max 10 options in a radio/checkbox

number allows for user to enter value if they enter more than that only first set of digits are taken
(e.g. 34m = 34)
(decimal places are not allowed)

The value must be between min and max, which can be set to the same if only allow specific value
If they enter the word (e.g. ten) then it will fail
Only positive numbers supported (see above regarding -1).

regexp in answer does not include / chars - it will be matched with -i

Answer is to be included in the reason - preferably surrounded by <b> tags or similar.


PHP Session
-----------

Instead of using Session cache in the database this is moved into a PHP session.
This is stored and retrieved using a QuizSession class (which uses PHPSession).
[quizname] - quiz being used
[status] - 
Store following variables as serialised arrays for the ones below
array position is the question number (eg. 1 to 25)
[question] - question number in quiz table
[answer] - (-1 for no answer) - text / int of the answer

Status values are:
(0 = not setup yet, not normally used - potential future use)
(1 = active in quiz, ie answering questions)
(2 = completed - answers marked in review mode) // blocks user from changing completed quiz
(5 = offline mode)
(10 = admin - adding / deleting questions)





Quiz Table
----------

Holds information about each quiz
can be used to enable / disable quiz etc.

quizid int pri autoincrement
quizname varchar 255 unique	- shortname, needs to be post friendly (no spaces)				// this could have been used as primary key, but would have made changing shortname very difficult
title varchar 255 - Long title (user friendly)
numquestions int		// Note this is the number of questions to be provided for the quiz (not total number of questions)	default 0
numquestionsoffline int	// default 0
quizintro text			// Overview of the quiz
priority int			// used to sort menu etc. - highest first - default 1
enableonline boolean	// - assuming online quiz is enabled - default false (0)
enableoffline boolean	// - assuming offline quiz is enabled - default false (0)


Question -> Quiz Table

Question Table Layout
----------------------

Primarily for the need to remove the fixed entries in set the new format is:
From 0.3.2

Install
-------

See the adminstration user guide

Administration
--------------

Adminsistration login works across all quizzes. 

Case Sensitive
--------------
Question type TEXT is case sensitive
If we need to prompt user, then it should be done in the question, there is no
specific code in the program to notify user


Browser autoprompt
------------------
To prevent the autoprompt from the browser a short part of the session 
is used in the name of the "answer" field. Eg. for text, number and TEXT 
field name is answeruvwxyz - where uvwxyz is taken from the session
