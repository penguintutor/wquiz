*** Important things that must be completed before next release ***

The following are important issues that must be handled correctly before a public
release is made or before this is used on a production system.

Add GPLv3 headers to source code
remove test folder
add logout button

*** Future features ***
Improve install script
	Add security feature to move second config file into a safe directory
	


*** Limitations ***

Maximum size for settings is 255 characters.
This poses a limitation for storing arrays inside as these are serialised before storage
The max size can be increased by changing the varchar size, but 255 is the maximum
size prior to MySQL 5.0.3 and will therefore increase the pre-req for mysql
See: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/char.html for mysql information







*** Known bugs ***

N/A - still under active development
