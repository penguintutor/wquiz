****** Development *******


*** Future features ***
Add filter / search function to admin

Additional checking using Javascript (eg. admin save)
Improve install script
	Add security feature to move second config file into a safe directory

Change session expired message - to be clearer and within main body of index.php

Changes required for linear quiz type (ie do not allow backward direction)
	
Add alternative options in admin - eg. after creating new question suggest "add another?"
perhaps use a separate menu with different options

Update handling of the answer field in admin - and that we don't allow invalid answer fields to be created

Allow messages to be customised eg. Finished reviewing?
Allow buttons to be customised "start"
Better way of adding text blocks
	Should it be in the themes?
	In a seperate table?
	As embedded files?

Add iframe support

Easier adding of questions through admin
eg. when choosing radio it provides multiple fields to add the different options


*** Limitations ***

Maximum size for settings is 255 characters.
This poses a limitation for storing arrays inside as these are serialised before storage
The max size can be increased by changing the varchar size, but 255 is the maximum
size prior to MySQL 5.0.3 and will therefore increase the pre-req for mysql
See: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/char.html for mysql information

When performing an upgrade the old config file must be in a very specific format
See upgrade instructions
