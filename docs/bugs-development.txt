*** Important things that must be completed before next release ***

The following are important issues that must be handled correctly before a public
release (beta or higher) is made or before this is used on a production system.

Add GPLv3 headers to source code
Add status information to install script
Add upgrade from older version
Check on handling of the answer field - and that we don't allow invalid answer fields to be created
Clean out old entries from sample css file
Add offline quiz option
Add iframe (at least for the start page)
Add documentation


*** Future features ***
Additional checking using Javascript (eg. admin save)
Improve install script
	Add security feature to move second config file into a safe directory
	


*** Limitations ***

Maximum size for settings is 255 characters.
This poses a limitation for storing arrays inside as these are serialised before storage
The max size can be increased by changing the varchar size, but 255 is the maximum
size prior to MySQL 5.0.3 and will therefore increase the pre-req for mysql
See: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/char.html for mysql information



*** Known bugs ***

N/A - still under active development
