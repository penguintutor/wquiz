*** Important things that must be completed before next release ***

The following are important issues that must be handled correctly before a public
release (beta or higher) is made or before this is used on a production system.

Add documentation (eg. readme files)


*** Future features ***
Additional checking using Javascript (eg. admin save)
Improve install script
	Add security feature to move second config file into a safe directory

Change session expired message - to be clearer and within main body of index.php

Changes required for linear quiz type (ie do not allow backward direction)
	
Add alternative options in admin - eg. after creating new question suggest "add another?"
perhaps use a separate menu with different options

Update handling of the answer field in admin - and that we don't allow invalid answer fields to be created

Allow messages to be customised eg. Finished reviewing?
Allow buttons to be customised "start"
Better way of adding text blocks
	Should it be in the themes?
	In a seperate table?
	As embedded files?

Add iframe support

Easier adding of questions through admin
eg. when choosing radio it provides multiple fields to add the different options


*** Limitations ***

Maximum size for settings is 255 characters.
This poses a limitation for storing arrays inside as these are serialised before storage
The max size can be increased by changing the varchar size, but 255 is the maximum
size prior to MySQL 5.0.3 and will therefore increase the pre-req for mysql
See: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/char.html for mysql information

When performing an upgrade the old config file must be in a very specific format
See upgrade instructions



*** Changes since version 0.3.? ***

templates completely changed - PHP
	All templates need to be recreated
New CSS elements created
text based answers now test for complete string ie. /^<search>$/ - previously did not
    * Text questions will need to be reviewed *
Some quizzes may be reenabled through upgrade
quizzes ordering will be lost with upgrade
Change to menu navigation - now post based, no longer requires "answer" button
Online / Offline quizzes can now be enabled on a per quiz basis - and have different number of questions




*** Known bugs ***

N/A - still under active development
